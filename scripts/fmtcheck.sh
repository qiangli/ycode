# fmtcheck — the formatting gate. REPORTS, NEVER REWRITES.
#
# THE ONE implementation; every caller delegates here so the scope can never
# drift between them:
#   - scripts/hooks/pre-push (automatic, once core.hooksPath is set)
#   - `make fmtcheck`
#
# # Why this fails instead of fixing
#
# The obvious version of this gate runs `gofmt -w` and commits the result. Do
# not write that version. gofmt does not only move whitespace: on doc comments
# it applies godoc's legacy typographic substitution, turning a pair of ASCII
# single-quotes into a curly closing quote.
#
# That is a silent content change, and it is not hypothetical — it has already
# corrupted a comment in a sibling repo that quoted shell syntax, leaving a test
# harness documenting a form that does not exist. Nothing reported it: the diff
# looks like formatting, and formatting diffs are what reviewers skim.
#
# So the rule is: a human decides. When a file legitimately cannot take gofmt's
# output, the fix is to restructure it — move the literal into an indented
# doc-comment code block, where the characters survive verbatim — not to accept
# a rewrite of what the code says.
#
# `make tidy` still runs `go fmt` and that is fine: it is an APPLY step someone
# asked for. The distinction is that a GATE must not silently change content.
#
# # Scope
#
# Tracked .go files only, so build output and scratch files never fail the gate.
