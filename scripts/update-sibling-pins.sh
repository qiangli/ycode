# The counterpart to scripts/hooks/pre-push: the hook refuses a push while a pin
# disagrees with its sibling's HEAD, and this rewrites the pins so it agrees.
# Comments and line order are preserved; a sibling that isn't checked out next
# to this repo keeps its existing pin (a standalone clone has none to read).
#
# Idempotent. Safe to re-run.

Pins updated. Commit them alongside the change that needs them:

  git commit -am 'chore: bump .sibling-pins'

Push each bumped sibling to its own origin first — CI clones the pin from
GitHub, so a SHA that exists only on this machine fails there.
